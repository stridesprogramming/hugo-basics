#Taking Inventory

The first step in the installation process is noting what software you have installed. I'm running a Linux operating system (Ubuntu 18.04) and have Hugo (0.74.3) installed. If you don't have Hugo yet, follow their [installation instructions](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing).
