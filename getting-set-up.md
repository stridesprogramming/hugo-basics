# Taking Inventory

Do you know how to use the terminal?  If you don't, [start here](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial/basics).

The first step in the installation process is noting what software you have installed. I'm running a Linux operating system (Ubuntu 18.04) and have Hugo (0.74.3) installed. If you don't have Hugo yet, follow their [installation instructions](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing). With Hugo installed, run `hugo new site best-website` in the terminal.
